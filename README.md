# pfSense Firewall / Router

## Introduction

I am thrilled to share the installation of pfSense in this lab. pfSense is a free, open-source firewall and router, based on the FreeBSD operating system. It's a highly flexible and stateful firewall. It provides a powerful, enterprise-grade set of features, including a robust firewall, VPN gateway, and advanced routing capabilities. By default, the installation will use two NIC cards: one for the WAN network, which connects to the internet, and the other for the LAN network, representing our Layer 2 switch.
